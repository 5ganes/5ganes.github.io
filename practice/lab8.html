Problem 1 Output :
undefined // variable x is hoisted since it has been declared and assignment in 
          // global scope as well as local(function scope) : it will be considered as undefined

8         // even though a is defined as global scope, 8 is passed as a in function c()
          // so a will have local scope inside this function

8         // local variable b inside function f is assigned with value of local variable a(=8)
          // local scope

9         // value of local variable b inside function c which is 9

10        // value of global scope variable b outside of all the functions which is 10

1         // value of global scope variable a outside of all the functions which is 1
